This project is about developing an interactive game called Tic-Tac-Toe Game (which we all played in our childhood i.e., Zero, Kaata in Hindi). It is basically a gaming application written or made using HTML, CSS , Bootstrap and JavaScript. The rule of the game are simple :- 
(1) The game is played on a grid that is 3 squares by 3 squares.
(2) You are X, your friend is O.
(3) The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
(4) When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If nobody wins, it is a draw.
